<h2><strong>About</h2></strong>
<p>Toxic online content has become a major issue in todayâ€™s world due to an exponential increase in the use of the internet by people of different cultures and educational backgrounds. Differentiating hate speech and offensive language is a key challenge in the automatic detection of toxic text content.</p>


<h2><strong>Overview</h2></strong>

<p>The goal is to classify tweets into two categories, hate speech or non-hate speech. We can get tweets from any hashtag using Twitter API and then classify the tweets as hate or non-hate speech. This will help in reducing the toxic content on Twitter or any other platform by banning the people that use offensive language and spread hatred.</p>
